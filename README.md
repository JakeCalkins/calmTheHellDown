## I. Capture.
Take in user information including:
- Item name
- Item wattage
- Item 'tag' (essentially a room categorization and usage categorization
  - ie. A microwave would be tagged: 'kitchen', 'food'
- Energy cost (/W)
  - Can be location based (pull from webCrawl)

## II. Process.
- Use categories to generate a series of sliders
- Present user with these sliders to determine their usage, and how much is day v. night (to account for lights)

## III. Conclude.
- Present user a report custom to their usage and captured data. Demonstrate estimated cost of the bulk of their usage, and data informing them on how to change their habits to save electricity.
